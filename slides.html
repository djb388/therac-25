# What is Therac 25?

---

# What is Therac 25?

- Medical Electron accelerator, used for electron therapy
- Two modes, direct and deep (5 Mev - 25 Mev, 25 Mev)
- Developed by Atomic Enegy of Canada Limited (AECL) in 1982
- 11 were installed in US, 6 in Canada

???

- Direct electron-beam
- Megavvolt X-ray
- Mev = Mega Electron Volts
- therac-6 &amp; therac-20 came before

# What is Therac 25?

- Massive radiation overdoses
- 6 major accidents resulting in injury and death
- "Worst series of radiation accidents in 35-year history"<br />(Leveson and Turner, 1993, p. 1)

# Patient Case Studies

---

# “You burned me!”

### 1st patient
- June 1985, Kennestone Regional Oncology Center, Marietta GA
- Patient's breast had to be removed, and she completely lost the use of her shoulder and arm.
<br />(Leveson and Turner, 1993, p. 22)

---

# “You burned me!”

### 2nd patient
- July 1985, Ontario Cancer Foundation clinic in Canada
- She died three months later of cancer, but a total hip-replacement would have been necessary if she had continued to live.
<br />(Leveson and Turner, 1993, p. 23)

---

# “You burned me!”

### 3rd patient
- Dec 1985, Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital, WA
- The patient received only minor disability and scarring from the accident.
<br />(Leveson and Turner, 1993, p. 26-27)

---

# Deaths

### 4th patient
- March 1986, East Texas Cancer Center, TX
- The patient eventually loss the use of his left arm and both legs, was unable to speak, and had several other complications. He died from complications five months later.
<br />(Leveson and Turner, 1993, p. 27-28)

---

# Deaths

### 5th patient
- April 1986, East Texas Cancer Center, TX
- He died three weeks after the accident, after falling into a coma and suffering severe neurological damage.
<br />(Leveson and Turner, 1993, p. 28)

---

# Deaths

### 6th patient
- January 1987, Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital, WA
- The Patient died three months later from complications related to the overdose.
<br />(Leveson and Turner, 1993, p. 33)

# Current Software Regulations

.center[![FDA Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djb388/therac-25/master/FDA.png)]

- Audits software in medical and non-medical devices
- Multiple regulatory requirements
- Design validation, Automated processes, Corrective and preventative action
- Basic Software Requirements
- Records, Integration and Unit testing, Design history file, Quality audits, and many, many more.
- "...software engineering needs an even greater level of managerial
scrutiny and control than does hardware engineering."

# Aftermath

---

# International Electrotechnical Commission

- International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 62304
- Medical device software life cycle processes
- Supersedes previous ISO standards
- 1996 amendment addressed failures
- SOUP: software of unknown pedigree
